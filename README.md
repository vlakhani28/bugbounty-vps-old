### Limitation(s)
- Your work does not get saved, so save it on cloud like GDrive
- GOLang is pre downloaded and extracted, the path is not set You have to run the following command: export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin
- Add telegram notifications
- 

### To-Do(s)
- Find a working solution for Go so that it gets pre-installed
- Add Mounting/Unmounting of GDrive 
- Add more tools (Twitter DM me if you want any tools to be added https://twitter.com/vlakhani28)

##### Note: The orignal code is https://github.com/RixEtte/heroku-vnc, I just modified it a bit to make this set up for Bug Bounty Hunting.
